# SPAM-Detection through Machine Learning Techniques

This project is focused on the study of Machine Learning techniques for spam detection. The techniques used on this project are:
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM 
- Logistic Regression 
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest

This techniques have been tested against the datasets you can see next:
- **Enron spam dataset (enron on the repository):** This dataset was used on the paper titled *Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes - Which Naive Bayes?* proceeded from the third conference about email and anti-spam in 2006. There are two versions of this dataset. A pre-processed version (the one used on this project) and a raw version. On the pre-processed version there aren't duplicate messages, plus, a random sub-sample has been done, in order to get the ratios of spam emails and legit emails. This dataset can be downloaded from: http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/.

- **PU CORPORA:** This dataset has been used to develop the paper titled *Filter Unsolicited Commercial E-mail* by *I. Androutsopoulos, G. Paliouras, E. Michelakis.* This dataset counts with 4 sub-directories which content 11 subdirectories (1 per fold used on cross-validation process), plus one directory called *unused*, which content discard emails, to store the same number of legit emails and spam emails. This dataset can be downloaded from: http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/PU123ACorpora.tar.gz.
