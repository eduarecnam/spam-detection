# SPAM-Detection through Machine Learning Techniques

This project is focused on the study of Machine Learning techniques for spam detection. The techniques used on this project are:
- Naive Bayes
- KNN
- SVM 
- Logistic Regression 
- Decision Tree 
- Random Forest

This techniques have been tested against the datasets you can see next:
- **Enron spam dataset (enron on the repository):** This dataset was used on the paper titled *Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes - Which Naive Bayes?* proceeded from the third conference about email and anti-spam in 2006. There are two versions of this dataset. A pre-processed version (the one used on this project) and a raw version. On the pre-processed version there aren't duplicate messages, plus, a random sub-sample has been done, in order to get the ratios of spam emails and legit emails. This dataset can be downloaded from: http://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/.

<!--PU CORPORA Originally this datset has been divied into spam/ham emails of easy and hard detection. But, on this project all of this emails have been unified into spam/ham emails, so there is no differentiation between easy or hard detection. This dataset is compossed of 6047 emails which 31% is spam. All of the emails keep their headers, some of the addresses have been offuscaded and in some cases the hostname has been replaced by the string spamassasin.taint.org. Finally and not less important, this dataset can be downloaded from the URL:-->
